The vernier scale usually has length of 9mm and is divided equally into 10 \\ndivisions. The separation between two lines on vernier scale is 9/10 mm=0.9mm.

Exact values are those that are counted \\nclearly. For example, while reporting 3 pencils or 2 books , we can indicate the exact number of \\nthese items. \\nOn the other hand, values associated with measurements of any kind are uncertain to some extent.'),\n",
